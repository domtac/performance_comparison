# Performance measurement

Unsorted collection of algorithm for the prupose of doing basic benchmarks between Rust, go and python. 

My key take away is to never forget to `--release` my rust code ever again.

The algorithms used here are differnet apporaches to sorting random numbers. 
So far I have done:
- Bubblesort
- Insertions sort
- Quick sort
- Parallel quicksort

### Bonus: Parallel quick sort

As the manufacturers of my  laptop where so kind to provide me with several computation cores, I was willing to try a parallel quicksort to speed up the sorting even more. Another reason is that I wanted to try out the [rayon](https://crates.io/crates/rayon/1.2.1) crate.

The interesting effect here is, that rayon really allowed parallelism w/o significant overhead, whereas the parallel inplementation in go or python had little effect. For Go the parallelism even made it slower.

| Parallel quick sort | 100000 | 150 | 25 | 1.7 | 61 |


## Running the tests

No elaborated runner in place here. I assume that you have python3, rust and go installed on your machine.

To run the tests:
__Python__
Navigate into the python folder and:
```shell
python3 bubblesort.py
python3 insertionsort.py
python3 quicksort.py
python3 par_quicksort.py
```

__Golang__
Navigate into the go folder and:
```shell
go run bubblesort.go
go run insertionsort.go
go run quicksort.go
go run par_quicksort.go
```

__Rust__
Stay in the root folder and:
```shell
cargo run --bin bubble_sort
cargo run --bin insertion_sort
cargo run --bin quick_sort
cargo run --bin par_quick_sort
```
To get the release run add a `--release` to the above mentioned commands
